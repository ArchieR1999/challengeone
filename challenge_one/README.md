# Code Refactor Starter Code

# What to do?
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


# Description
This project allowed one to observe a codebase whose accessibility standards were followed and optimized esepcially for search engines.
When the source code, structure of the HTML, title, image elements and heading attributes were viewed, then semantic elements were found which followed a logical structure, with all alt and heading attributes falling in sequential order.
