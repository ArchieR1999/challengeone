# Code Refactor 

## Description
This project allowed one to observe a codebase whose accessibility standards were followed and optimized esepcially for search engines.
When the source code, structure of the HTML, title, image elements and heading attributes were viewed, then semantic elements were found which followed a logical structure, with all alt and heading attributes falling in sequential order. The link to the website is https://archier1999.github.io/challengew/ and everything seems to be in working order.
